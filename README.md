Ocean trash tracker
A web application that predicts the location of ocean trash based on user inputs (date, time, latitude, and longitude). It displays a map with markers for the user's chosen location and the nearest port. The application is built using Flask for the backend and Folium/Leaflet for map visualization on the frontend.
